The Nox bot project is a work in progress. Here's an installation guide in case you'd like to try it out for yourself.


1.) Make sure you host with OpenNox. Get the latest release from here: https://github.com/noxworld-dev/opennox/releases

2.) Download the files from https://github.com/Ephreaym/Nox-AI-script/tree/main and place them into the map folder you'd like to host. For example: C:\Program Files (x86)\Nox\Maps\Estate\

3.) You can now host a game with bots enabled! Make sure to either host a CTF map or enable teams for arena. The game will crash without teams enabled.

You can change settings in game through chat (altering the settings in the code directly is not advised).

Some basic server settings:
server spawn red/blue war/con/wiz

server hardcore/hard/normal/easy/beginner bots
