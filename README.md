# Bot Script
The Bot Script enables hosting a server with bots in OpenNox. You can join the OpenNox server with any Nox cliënt (for example NoxReloaded) since OpenNox is backwards compatible. However, it's recommended to join with OpenNox since some features are OpenNox exclusive. The project is a work in progress. Bugs are present and crashes can occur. Your feedback is very valuable to improve the Bot Script. You can report issues here: https://github.com/Ephreaym/Bot-Script/issues

## Implemented Features
- Play with Warrior, Conjurer and Wizard bots
- Play team Arena and Capture the Flag with bots.
- Flexible bot difficulty settings.
- Customizable ruleset for the bots.

## Planned Features
- Play all game modes with bots, with or without teams: Arena, Elimination, King of the Realm, Capture the Flag, Flagball and Quest.

## Installation Guide
1.) Make sure to host with with the latest release of OpenNox. You can get the latest release from: https://github.com/noxworld-dev/opennox/releases

2.) Download the Bot Script files from: https://github.com/Ephreaym/Nox-AI-script/tree/main Place the files into the map folder you'd like to host. For example: C:\Program Files (x86)\Nox\Maps\Estate\

3.) You can now host a game with bots enabled. If installed properly you'll get the following message on map launch: "Bot script installed succesfully!" Bots are currently only enabled for Capture the Flag and Team Arena. Bots are (for now) disabled in other game modes.

## Server commands

You can change settings on demand in game through chat. Another possibility is editing the Bot Script files before launching the map, although this is not adviced. 

**General Server Options**
