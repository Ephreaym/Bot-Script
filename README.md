# Bot Script
The Bot Script enables hosting a server with bots in OpenNox. You can join the OpenNox server with any Nox cliÃ«nt (for example NoxReloade) since OpenNox is backwars compatible. However, it's recommended to join with OpenNox since some features are OpenNox exclusive. The project is a work in progress. 

## Features

## Installation Guide
1.) Make sure to host with with the latest release of OpenNox. You can get the latest release from: https://github.com/noxworld-dev/opennox/releases

2.) Download the Bot Script files from: https://github.com/Ephreaym/Nox-AI-script/tree/main Place the files into the map folder you'd like to host. For example: C:\Program Files (x86)\Nox\Maps\Estate\

3.) You can now host a game with bots enabled. If installed properly you'll get the following message on map launch: "Bot script installed succesfully!" Bots are currently only enabled for Capture the Flag (CTF) and Team Arena. Bots are (for now) disabled in other game modes.

## Server commands

You can change settings in game through chat (altering the settings in the code directly is not advised).

Some basic server settings:
server spawn red/blue war/con/wiz

server hardcore/hard/normal/easy/beginner bots
